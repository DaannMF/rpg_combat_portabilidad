- Do not add summary comments of any kind.
- Do not add any type of code comments.
- Do not modify or create any .meta file
- Do not add or create markdown files unless is explicitly requested.
- Code must be always in english.
- Do not declare or initialize variables using `var` always indicate type.
- Constants and properties should go before any methods on a class.
- Always add unityÂ´s lifecycle methods on top of the class, other manually implemented methods should go after.
- Never leave ANY unused code (Methods, properties, const's, etc), code should be clean.
