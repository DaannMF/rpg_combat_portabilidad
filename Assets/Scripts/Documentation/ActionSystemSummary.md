# Action System Implementation Summary

## Overview

The RPG Combat System has been successfully refactored to use a UI-based action system instead of keyboard numbers. The system now features dynamic button creation, player-specific abilities, enhanced movement with speed limits, and improved enemy AI.

## Key Changes

### 1. New Action System Architecture

#### **ActionType Enum** (`Assets/Scripts/Enums/ActionType.cs`)

- Defines all possible actions: `MeleeAttack`, `RangedAttack`, `HealSelf`, `HealOther`, `Move`, `EndTurn`
- Includes extension methods for display names

#### **PlayerAction Class** (`Assets/Scripts/Data/PlayerAction.cs`)

- Represents individual actions with target information
- Includes availability status and distance requirements

#### **IPlayerAbilitySystem Interface** (`Assets/Scripts/Data/IPlayerAbilitySystem.cs`)

- Follows Dependency Inversion Principle
- Defines contract for ability management

#### **PlayerAbilitySystem Class** (`Assets/Scripts/Data/PlayerAbilitySystem.cs`)

- Implements player-specific ability rules:
  - **Player1 (Fighter)**: Self-heal, melee attacks only (adjacent enemies)
  - **Player2 (Healer)**: Self-heal, heal others (range 2), melee + ranged attacks (range 3)
  - **Player3 (Ranger)**: Self-heal, melee (adjacent) + ranged attacks (unlimited range)

### 2. Enhanced Movement System

#### **MovementSystem Class** (`Assets/Scripts/Data/MovementSystem.cs`)

- Tracks remaining movement per turn based on character speed
- Validates movement constraints (1 cell at a time, within speed limit)
- Provides valid movement positions

### 3. Action Controller

#### **PlayerActionController Class** (`Assets/Scripts/Data/PlayerActionController.cs`)

- Central coordinator for player actions and movement
- Implements `IPlayerController` interface
- Manages action availability and execution
- Provides event-driven updates to UI

### 4. UI System

#### **PlayerActionUI Class** (`Assets/Scripts/UI/PlayerActionUI.cs`)

- Dynamic button creation for available actions
- Shows/hides based on current player type
- Displays movement counter and current player info

#### **ActionButton Class** (`Assets/Scripts/UI/ActionButton.cs`)

- Reusable button component for actions
- Handles action setup and callback registration

### 5. Enhanced Enemy AI

#### **Improved Enemy Intelligence**

- Strategic movement towards nearest attackable player
- Prioritizes weak targets (lowest health)
- Improved pathfinding for optimal positioning

## Player-Specific Rules Implementation

### Player 1 - Fighter (Melee Specialist)

```csharp
- Speed: 3 cells
- Abilities: Self-heal, Melee attack (adjacent only)
- Restrictions: Cannot attack at range, cannot heal others
```

### Player 2 - Healer (Support)

```csharp
- Speed: 2 cells  
- Abilities: Self-heal, Heal others (range 2), Melee + Ranged attack (range 3)
- Versatile: Can support team or engage in combat
```

### Player 3 - Ranger (Ranged Specialist)

```csharp
- Speed: 4 cells
- Abilities: Self-heal, Melee (adjacent), Ranged attack (unlimited range)
- Strengths: High mobility, long-range attacks
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Unity Scene Setup

1. **GameManager Configuration**:
   - Assign `PlayerActionUI` GameObject to `playerActionUI` field
   - Ensure all character sprites are assigned

2. **PlayerActionUI Setup**:
   - Create UI Canvas with PlayerActionUI component
   - Assign action button prefab (with ActionButton component)
   - Set button container (parent for dynamic buttons)
   - Assign movement text and current player text components
   - Assign end turn button

3. **Action Button Prefab**:
   - Create Button prefab with ActionButton component
   - Include Button and TextMeshPro components
   - Save as prefab for dynamic instantiation

### 2. Code Integration

The system uses reflection temporarily for compilation compatibility. Once all scripts are compiled, the reflection calls will work correctly.

### 3. Controls

- **Movement**: WASD keys (limited by speed stat)
- **Actions**: Click UI buttons for available actions
- **End Turn**: Click "End Turn" button

## SOLID Principles Compliance

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- `MovementSystem`: Only handles movement logic
- `PlayerAbilitySystem`: Only manages ability rules
- `PlayerActionController`: Only coordinates actions
- `PlayerActionUI`: Only handles UI display

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- New character types can be added to `PlayerAbilitySystem`
- New action types can be added to `ActionType` enum
- UI system extensible for new button types

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- `PlayerAbilitySystem` implements `IPlayerAbilitySystem`
- `PlayerActionController` implements `IPlayerController`

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- Interfaces are focused and specific
- Components only depend on methods they use

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- High-level modules depend on abstractions
- `PlayerActionController` depends on `IPlayerAbilitySystem`

## Event-Driven Architecture

The system uses events for loose coupling:

- `OnActionsUpdated`: UI updates when actions change
- `OnMovementUpdated`: Movement counter updates
- `OnActionExecuted`: Action execution feedback

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Player1 can only heal self and melee attack
- [ ] Player2 can heal others and use ranged/melee attacks
- [ ] Player3 has unlimited range attacks
- [ ] Movement is limited by speed stat
- [ ] Enemy AI prioritizes weak targets
- [ ] UI buttons appear/disappear based on availability
- [ ] Turn system works with individual player turns

## Future Enhancements

- Animation integration for actions
- Sound effects for different actions
- Visual feedback for valid move positions
- Tooltip system for action descriptions
- Save/load game state
