# RPG Combat System - Design Document

## Overview

This document explains the design decisions, SOLID principles implementation, and optimization considerations for the RPG Combat System.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Systems

1. **Grid System**: Manages the 4x6 battlefield and position tracking
2. **Character System**: Handles character behavior, stats, and actions
3. **Turn Manager**: Controls the turn-based gameplay flow
4. **Game Manager**: Orchestrates the overall game state and win/lose conditions
5. **UI System**: Displays game information and handles user feedback

## SOLID Principles Implementation

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility:

- `GridSystem`: Only handles grid management and position validation
- `TurnManager`: Only manages turn order and turn transitions
- `Character`: Only handles character state and behavior
- `GameManager`: Only manages game state and character spawning
- `GameUI`: Only handles UI display and updates

### 2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

The system is open for extension but closed for modification:

- `BaseCharacterStats` is a ScriptableObject that can be extended for new character types
- `Character` is an abstract base class that can be extended for new character behaviors
- New character types can be added by creating new classes that inherit from `Character`
- New stats can be added to `BaseCharacterStats` without modifying existing code

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Derived classes can be substituted for their base classes:

- `Player` and `Enemy` can both be used wherever `Character` is expected
- Both implement `ExecuteTurn()` method with their specific behaviors
- The `TurnManager` handles both player and enemy turns uniformly

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

While not using explicit interfaces, the system follows ISP concepts:

- Characters only expose methods they actually use
- `Player` class has player-specific methods like `SetAsCurrentPlayer()`
- `Enemy` class has AI-specific methods like `FindNearestPlayer()`
- Events are used to decouple dependencies

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules:

- `GameManager` depends on abstractions (`Character`) rather than concrete implementations
- `TurnManager` works with abstract `Character` class
- Systems communicate through events rather than direct references
- ScriptableObjects provide configuration without tight coupling

## Design Patterns Used

### 1. Observer Pattern

- Events are used throughout the system for loose coupling
- `Character.OnCharacterDeath` notifies interested parties
- `TurnManager.OnTurnStart/OnTurnEnd` updates UI and game state
- `GameManager.OnGameWon/OnGameLost` triggers game over states

### 2. Strategy Pattern

- Different character types implement different strategies for `ExecuteTurn()`
- Players use input-based strategy
- Enemies use AI-based strategy

### 3. Factory Pattern

- `CharacterStatsConfigurator` creates different character stat configurations
- `GameManager` spawns characters using factory-like methods

### 4. Command Pattern (Implicit)

- Character actions (Move, Attack, Heal) are encapsulated as methods
- Input handling translates key presses to character actions

## Optimization Considerations

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Object Pooling**: Could be implemented for frequently created/destroyed objects
2. **Efficient Grid Lookups**: Dictionary-based position lookups in O(1) time
3. **Event-Driven Updates**: UI only updates when necessary through events
4. **Caching**: Distance calculations are done on-demand rather than precomputed

### Memory Optimizations

1. **ScriptableObjects**: Character stats are shared references, not duplicated
2. **Struct Usage**: `GridPosition` is a struct for better memory layout
3. **List Reuse**: Using LINQ efficiently for character filtering

### Code Optimizations

1. **Early Returns**: Validation checks return early to avoid unnecessary processing
2. **Null Checks**: Defensive programming with null checks
3. **Efficient Algorithms**: Manhattan distance for grid-based calculations

## Character Configuration

### Player 1 (Fighter)

- Health: 20 HP
- Speed: 3 cells
- Melee Attack: 5 damage
- Ranged Attack: None
- Healing: 2 HP (self only)

### Player 2 (Healer)

- Health: 15 HP
- Speed: 2 cells
- Melee Attack: 2 damage
- Ranged Attack: 2 damage (range 3)
- Healing: 5 HP (self and others, range 2)

### Player 3 (Ranger)

- Health: 15 HP
- Speed: 4 cells
- Melee Attack: 1 damage
- Ranged Attack: 3 damage (unlimited range)
- Healing: 2 HP (self only)

### Enemy

- Health: 10 HP
- Speed: 1 cell
- Melee Attack: 3 damage
- Ranged Attack: 1 damage (range 3)
- Healing: None

## Input Controls

### Movement

- WASD or Arrow Keys: Move one cell in direction
- Space: Skip movement phase

### Actions

- 1: Attack nearest enemy
- 2: Heal self (if possible)
- 3: Heal nearest player (if possible)
- Space: Skip action phase
- Enter: Force end turn

## Win/Lose Conditions

### Victory

- All enemies are defeated
- At least one player survives

### Defeat

- All players are defeated
- Any enemies remain alive

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Animation System**: Add character movement and action animations
2. **Sound System**: Add audio feedback for actions
3. **Save System**: Save game state and progress
4. **Difficulty Levels**: Different enemy configurations
5. **Multiplayer**: Network-based multiplayer support
6. **Level Editor**: Tools for creating custom battlefields

### Technical Improvements

1. **Async Operations**: Non-blocking enemy AI processing
2. **Pathfinding**: A* algorithm for complex movement
3. **Ability System**: More complex character abilities
4. **Inventory System**: Equipment and items
5. **Particle Effects**: Visual feedback for actions

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Testing

- Character stat calculations
- Grid position validation
- Turn order management
- Win/lose condition detection

### Integration Testing

- Character spawning and positioning
- Turn transitions
- UI updates
- Game state changes

### Performance Testing

- Large grid sizes
- Multiple character types
- Long game sessions
- Memory usage monitoring

## Conclusion

This RPG Combat system demonstrates solid software engineering principles with a focus on maintainability, extensibility, and performance. The modular design allows for easy addition of new features while maintaining code quality and readability.
